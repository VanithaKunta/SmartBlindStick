### Smart Blind Stick for Visually Impaired People

One of the biggest problems faced by the visually impaired is navigating from place to place, be it indoors or outdoors. Further, the adverse conditions of the roads make it even more difficult for them to walk outdoors. They have to be alert at all times to avoid consequences like colliding with stable or moving obstacles, ascending or descending staircases, slipping down wet terrain. Also, at times they may be in distress and might want to send an alert message to their relatives or friends about their whereabouts. 

These problems of blind people can be addressed with the intervention of technology. The proposed solution employs the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm to provide a medium between the blind and the environment.  Several sensors can be used to detect anomalies like obstacles, staircases and wet terrains respectively. 
  - The prototype discussed here is a simple, sophisticated and affordable smart blind stick equipped with various IoT sensors and modules.
  - Also, this solution provides a way to send a message about the whereabouts of the user to the concerned people. 
  - Adding to the above, a software application is designed to help the acquaintances of the blind to manage the stickâ€™s configuration 
      - ex: add or delete phone numbers to which alert messages have to be sent. 
  - Misplacing the stick indoors can also be a substantial issue. This solution also addresses this problem.
